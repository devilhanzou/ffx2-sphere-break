# FFX2 Sphere Break Took
This tool was developed after many frustrating hours trying to beat the Sphere Break Elites. Let me be clear - it will not guarantee you a victory every time you play, as some luck is needed against some opponents (especially the Elites, where a random core-1 in the middle of the game will annihilate your chances of a victory). However, it will allow you to quickly explore solutions that can keep your Echo streaks alive.

> Sphere break is a mini-game in FFX-2, just like card games in the past FFs. Basically, Sphere break is a game that's all about sums and multiplications. Instead of following the old system of card games, in which you can win easily if you have got some rare cards in your hand. This requires you to use a little brains. Sphere break is a race against the clock to create multiples of the core sphere's core number by combining numbers of the 16 coins on the board. Confusing? Well, like Shinra said, "Once you get the elementary, you will get the hang of it."
